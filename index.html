    <h1>Admiring the Sunset</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>A glorious sunset is the epitome of fleeting beauty. For a few minutes, the sky is a spectacle of color, and then it’s over. Yet the psychological effects of admiring the sunset may persist long after the color has faded.
        Studies show that appreciating natural beauty may boost well-being, increase generosity and enhance life satisfaction. The key is to actively engage with the experience. To reap the rewards of that sunset, you need to stop whatever else you’re doing and really notice and appreciate the show in the sky.</p>
